# Predicting Submarine Sonar Object Recognition in Python

## Introduction

Sonar (Sound Navigation and Ranging) is a technique used to detect objects underwater by transmitting sound pulses and analyzing the reflected echoes. This technology is crucial for submarines, which rely on sonar to navigate, detect obstacles, and recognize potential threats like underwater mines. The primary challenge is distinguishing between natural objects like rocks and man-made objects like mines, which is where machine learning (ML) comes into play.

## What is Sonar and How Does It Work?

Sonar systems emit sound pulses and listen for echoes that bounce back from objects. The time delay between sending the pulse and receiving the echo allows the sonar to calculate the distance to the object, while the strength and characteristics of the echo can help determine the object's nature. This is essential in underwater navigation, where visibility is limited.

## How is Sonar Used in Navigation?

Sonar plays a critical role in submarine navigation, obstacle recognition, mapping the seabed, and identifying threats. The system uses sound waves to detect and locate objects, leveraging principles like the Doppler effect to ascertain the relative speed and movement of objects.

## Signal Processing in Sonar Systems

Signal processing involves filtering and analyzing sonar signals to enhance object detection. Techniques such as time-frequency analysis help in distinguishing between different types of echoes, which can then be classified using machine learning models.

## Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning

ML models, particularly neural networks, have significantly improved the accuracy of sonar systems in recognizing and classifying underwater objects. These models analyze patterns in the sonar data to differentiate between rocks and mines with high precision.

## Visualizing Data with LightningChart

### Introduction to LightningChart for Python

LightningChart provides an efficient way to visualize large datasets in real-time, which is crucial for applications like sonar object recognition.

### Creating the Charts

**Brief Example Scripts and Diagrams:**

- **Correlation Heatmap of Sonar Features:** 
  - This heatmap visualizes the correlation between different features in the sonar dataset. Positive correlations are highlighted in red, while negative correlations are shown in blue. This helps in identifying which features are closely related, which could be useful for feature selection and reducing dimensionality in machine learning models.
  - 
``` python
import pandas as pd
import lightningchart as lc

data = pd.read_csv('sonar.csv', header=None)
corr_matrix = data.drop(columns=[60]).corr()

chart = lc.ChartXY(title='Correlation Heatmap of Sonar Features')
series = chart.add_heatmap_grid_series(
    columns=len(corr_matrix),
    rows=len(corr_matrix)
)
series.hide_wireframe()
series.invalidate_intensity_values(corr_matrix.values.tolist())
series.set_palette_colors([
    {"value": -1.0, "color": lc.Color(0, 0, 255)},
    {"value": 0.0, "color": lc.Color(255, 255, 255)},
    {"value": 1.0, "color": lc.Color(255, 0, 0)}
])
chart.open()
```

- **Density and Scatter Plots of Sonar Features:**
  - The density and scatter plots illustrate the distribution and relationships between pairs of sonar features, specifically for identifying mines (orange) versus rocks (blue). These visualizations are crucial for understanding how well features separate the two classes and for assessing the data's variability.

``` python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import lightningchart as lc

data = pd.read_csv('sonar.csv', header=None)
X = data.drop(columns=[60])
y = data[60]

dashboard = lc.Dashboard(rows=4, columns=4)

for i, col in enumerate(X.columns[:4]):
    chart = dashboard.ChartXY(row_index=i, column_index=i)
    series_r = chart.add_area_series()
    series_m = chart.add_area_series()

    series_r.add(np.linspace(min(X[col]), max(X[col]), 100), np.random.rand(100))
    series_m.add(np.linspace(min(X[col]), max(X[col]), 100), np.random.rand(100))

    chart.set_title(f'Density of Feature {col}')
    
dashboard.open()

```

- **Spider Chart for Mean Feature Values:**
  - The spider chart compares the mean feature values for rocks and mines across all features. The overlapping areas indicate features that may not contribute much to distinguishing between the two classes, while areas with clear separation may indicate useful features for classification.

``` python
import pandas as pd
import lightningchart as lc

data = pd.read_csv('sonar.csv', header=None)
X = data.drop(columns=[60])
y = data[60]

mean_rocks = X[y == 'R'].mean()
mean_mines = X[y == 'M'].mean()

chart = lc.SpiderChart(title='Mean Feature Values for Rocks and Mines')

for i in range(60):
    chart.add_axis(str(i))

series_rocks = chart.add_series().set_name('Rocks')
series_mines = chart.add_series().set_name('Mines')

series_rocks.add_points([{'axis': str(i), 'value': mean_rocks[i]} for i in range(60)])
series_mines.add_points([{'axis': str(i), 'value': mean_mines[i]} for i in range(60)])

chart.open()

```
![](Spider Chart for Mean Feature Values.png)

- **ROC Curves for Different Models:**
  - ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves for different models visualize the trade-off between true positive rates and false positive rates across various thresholds. Higher AUC (Area Under the Curve) values indicate better performance. These charts help compare the effectiveness of models in distinguishing between rocks and mines.
  
``` python
import pandas as pd
import lightningchart as lc
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc

data = pd.read_csv('sonar.csv', header=None)
X = data.drop(columns=[60])
y = data[60].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'M' else 0)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_scores = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(y_test, y_scores)
roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)

chart = lc.ChartXY(title='Logistic Regression ROC Curve')
series = chart.add_line_series().add(fpr.tolist(), tpr.tolist()).set_name('ROC Curve')
chart.open()

```
![](Images/ROC Curves for Different Models.png)

- **Feature Importance Bar Charts:**
  - These bar charts rank the importance of features based on how much they contribute to the model's predictions. Understanding feature importance helps in refining models by focusing on the most informative features, which can lead to better performance and reduced overfitting.

``` python
import pandas as pd
import lightningchart as lc
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

data = pd.read_csv('sonar.csv', header=None)
X = data.drop(columns=[60])
y = data[60].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'M' else 0)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
importances = model.feature_importances_

chart = lc.BarChart(title='Random Forest Feature Importances')
chart.set_data([{'category': str(i), 'value': imp} for i, imp in enumerate(importances)])
chart.open()
```
![](Images/Feature Importance Bar Charts.png)

- **Model Accuracy Over Iterations:**
  - These charts track the accuracy of different models on training and testing sets over multiple iterations. This visualization helps in assessing the model's learning progress and identifying potential overfitting if the training accuracy significantly outpaces the testing accuracy.

``` python
import pandas as pd
import lightningchart as lc
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

data = pd.read_csv('sonar.csv', header=None)
X = data.drop(columns=[60])

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=250)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

train_accuracy = model.score(X_train, y_train)
test_accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)

chart = lc.ChartXY(title='Logistic Regression Accuracy')
chart.add_line_series().add([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [train_accuracy] * 5).set_name('Training Accuracy')
chart.add_line_series().add([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [test_accuracy] * 5).set_name('Testing Accuracy')
chart.open()
```
![](Images/Model Accuracy Over Iterations.png)

  - Precision-Recall curves are particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets. They show the trade-off between precision and recall for different threshold values. High AUC values in these curves indicate that the model maintains a good balance between precision and recall, which is crucial for tasks like mine detection.

``` python
import pandas as pd
import lightningchart as lc
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve, auc

data = pd.read_csv('sonar.csv', header=None)
X = data.drop(columns=[60])
y = data[60].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'M' else 0)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_scores = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

precision, recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(y_test, y_scores)
pr_auc = auc(recall, precision)

chart = lc.ChartXY(title='Logistic Regression Precision-Recall Curve')
chart.add_line_series().add(recall.tolist(), precision.tolist()).set_name('Precision-Recall Curve')
chart.open()

```
![](Images/Precision-Recall Curves.png)

- **Real-Time Sonar Data Predictions:**
  - The line chart shows the real-time sonar raw data values over time, which are sent into the machine learning model for classification. The bar chart shows the cumulative number of predictions made by the model for "Rock" and "Mine."

``` python
import numpy as np
import lightningchart as lc
import time

def generate_sonar_data():
    return np.round(np.sin(np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 60)) + np.random.normal(0, 0.2, 60), 3)

dashboard = lc.Dashboard(rows=2, columns=1)

chart = dashboard.ChartXY(title='Real-Time Sonar Data Predictions')
series = chart.add_line_series(data_pattern='ProgressiveX')
chart.get_default_x_axis().set_scroll_strategy(strategy='progressive')

bar_chart = dashboard.BarChart(title='Cumulative Predictions')
bar_chart.set_data([{'category': 'Rock', 'value': 0}, {'category': 'Mine', 'value': 0}])

dashboard.open(live

```
